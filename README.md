# Interface Development Test

## Test instructions

In the linked Invision page you will find the designs for two components. Complete the following:

- The code should be submitted via a github account. Bonus points for more than one commit.
- Build the two blocks using modern HTML5 standards.
- Use JavaScript to capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()` the element which has been clicked.
- As with any modern web-build we expect a level of interactivity/animation to be displayed on the nodes.
- All content areas should be deemed as being populated from a CMS - so all copy lengths can vary!

## Technologies

- React - easier to setup, lightweight, abundant available library supports.

## Layout

- The layout is expected to work in the latest Chrome/FireFox/Edge versions.
- The layout should be responsive and work down to a `320px` mobile device.
- Bearing in mind that this application is expected to be responsive, the developer should consider the appropriate `<meta>` tags.
- **Section: All the latest:** Assume these items need anchor tags, but have no link defined.
- **Section: Answer your body's needs:** Each image in this section should display in a modal on click.
